== Advanced Usage

[[SetupCouchDB]]
=== Setting up your own CouchDB Server

It explains how to install CouchDB on Ubuntu 20.04.

TIP: Please also refer the official https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/unix.html[CouchDB install document].


==== Install CouchDB

Enabling the Apache CouchDB package repository:

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y gnupg ca-certificates
$ echo "deb https://apache.bintray.com/couchdb-deb focal main" \
 sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/couchdb.list
----

Installing the Apache CouchDB packages:

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys \
  8756C4F765C9AC3CB6B85D62379CE192D401AB61
----

and

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y couchdb
----

Under installing couchdb you have to answer for these questions:

* Server Type : standalone
* IP address : 127.0.0.1
* CouchdDB admin's password: _set up what you want_

After installing couchdb, check couchdb is running.

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo systemctl status couchdb
----

And you can use systemctl command options _stop, start, restart_.

An example when you stop CouchDB:

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo systemctl stop couchdb
----


==== Configure CouchDB

For using CouchDB as SmallSketch Note's server, just doing 4 steps under following. 

TIP: It needs _curl_ command. If necessary, do _sudo apt install curl_.


===== Prepearing

Before start configuring, check CouchDB is running by curl.

[source, shell]
----
$ curl http://admin:adminpasswd@127.0.0.1:5984/_up
----

TIP: Replace _adminpasswd_ with yours.

If CouchDB is running, returning such a message:

[source, json]
----
{"status":"ok","seeds":{}}
----

If not running, use systemctl command and make CouchDB running.

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo systemctl start couchdb
----
  

===== Step1 Add User

To add a CouchDB user, create a _user.json_ file in current dir like this:

[source, json]
----
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_id": "org.couchdb.user:alice",
      "name": "alice",
      "password": "aliceInWonderland",
      "roles": [],
      "type": "user"
    }
  ]
}
----

TIP: In this case, username is _alice_ and password is _aliceInWonderland_.  You can change them with what you want.


And do this:

[source, shell]
----
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d @user.json http://admin:adminpasswd@127.0.0.1:5984/_users/_bulk_docs
----

If this command works, you get the message like this:

[source, json]
----
[{"ok":true,"id":"org.couchdb.user:alice","rev":"1-18d335cdfa1c7df9f71fdab2e2ed0264"}]
----

The _alice_ user has been added.


===== Step2 Add Database

To add a CouchDB database, do this:

[source, shell]
----
$ curl -X PUT http://admin:adminpasswd@127.0.0.1:5984/ssnote
----

TIP: This _ssnote_ is database name. You can change another database name what you want.


If this command is successful, you get this message:

[source, json]
----
{"ok":true}
----


===== Step3 Add Security

Next, update this _ssnote_ database security for the _alice_ user.

To get current the _ssnote_ database security settings:

[source, shell]
----
$ curl -X GET http://admin:adminpasswd@127.0.0.1:5984/ssnote/_security
{"members":{"roles":["_admin"]},"admins":{"roles":["_admin"]}}
----

And a _create security.json_ file in current dir:

[source, json]
----
{
  "members": {
    "roles": [
      "_admin"
    ]
  },
  "admins": {
    "roles": [
      "_admin"
    ],
    "names": [
      "alice"
    ]
  }
}
----

TIP: This json file, just adding the _alice_ user into _admins.names_ from the current security settings json.

To update the security, do this:

[source, shell]
----
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d @security.json http://admin:adminpasswd@127.0.0.1:5984/ssnote/_security
{"ok":true}
----

Check if the user alice is in _admins.names_, get the security again:

[source, shell]
----
$ curl -X GET http://admin:adminpasswd@127.0.0.1:5984/ssnote/_security
----

////
MEMO: keep this note, but this setting is applied automatic by smallsketch note client. So there is no need to set up any more.

Add design document


Create _designdoc.json_ file in current dir:

[source, json]
----
{
  "language": "javascript",
  "views": {
    "count": {
      "map": "function(doc){ if(doc.sync_id!=null){ emit(doc.sync_id, 1) } }",
      "reduce": "function(key, value){ return sum(value) }"
    }
  }
}
----

And then do this:

[source, shell]
----
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d @designdoc.json http://admin:adminpasswd@127.0.0.1:5984/ssnote/_design/count
{"ok":true,"id":"_design/count","rev":"1-b380c17bbeaf2ab84a3415c6983c85e5"}
----

It has been added the design document _count_ in the _ssnote_ database.
////


===== Step4 Httpd 

This is the final step, make CouchDB as httpd.

Edit the CouchDB _local.ini_ file.
In Ubuntu 20.04, the _local.ini_ is placed in _/opt/couchdb/etc/local.ini_.

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo vi /opt/couchdb/etc/local.ini
----

And uncommentout _port_ and _bind_address_ settings in chttpd section, like this:

[source, plaintext]
----
[chttpd]
port = 5984
bind_address = 192.168.10.100
----

This binding IP Address _192.168.10.100_ is an example.
Change this value with yours.

To apply this settings, restart CouchDB:

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart couchdb
----

Let's check if it's workiing, access _http://192.168.10.100:5984/_ with browser.


That is all to config CouchDB for SmallSketch Note.

TIP: If you want use CouchDB on the internet, you can use nginx and reverse proxy.
