Install CouchDB 3.3 on your own server Ubuntu 22.04.

Please refer this official https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/unix.html[CouchDB install document].

Under installing couchdb you have to answer for a few questions:

* Server Type : standalone
* Magic Cookie : _any string you want_
* IP address : 127.0.0.1
* CouchdDB admin's password: _adminpass_

TIP: Of couse admin passwword _adminpass_ is an example.

After installing couchdb, check couchdb is running.

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo systemctl status couchdb
----

An example when you stop CouchDB:

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo systemctl stop couchdb

==== Config CouchDB for SmallSketch Note server

TIP: It needs _curl_ command. If necessary, do _sudo apt install curl_.


===== Step1 Prepearing

Before start configuring, check CouchDB is running by curl.

[source, shell]
----
$ curl http://admin:adminpass@127.0.0.1:5984/_up
----

TIP: Replace _adminpass_ with yours.

If CouchDB is running, returning such a message:

[source, json]
----
{"status":"ok","seeds":{}}
----

If not running, use systemctl command and make CouchDB running.

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo systemctl start couchdb
----
  

===== Step2 Add Database

To add a CouchDB database, do this:

[source, shell]
----
$ curl -X PUT http://admin:adminpass@127.0.0.1:5984/ssnote
----

TIP: This _ssnote_ is database name.


If this command is successful, you get this message:

[source, json]
----
{"ok":true}
----


===== Step3 Check Security

To get and check current the _ssnote_ database security settings:

[source, shell]
----
$ curl -X GET http://admin:adminpass@127.0.0.1:5984/ssnote/_security
{"members":{"roles":["_admin"]},"admins":{"roles":["_admin"]}}
----

It's OK. The user admin is set up.


===== Step4 Set up Httpd 

This is the final step, make CouchDB as httpd.

Edit the CouchDB _local.ini_ file.
In Ubuntu 20.04, the _local.ini_ is placed in _/opt/couchdb/etc/local.ini_.

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo vi /opt/couchdb/etc/local.ini
----

And uncommentout _port_ and _bind_address_ settings in chttpd section, like this:

[source, plaintext]
----
[chttpd]
port = 5984
bind_address = 192.168.10.100
----

This binding IP Address _192.168.10.100_ is an example.
Change this value with yours.

To apply this settings, restart CouchDB:

[source, shell]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart couchdb
